# Angular-Spring Boot-MongoDB Project

This project integrates Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB to create a robust and scalable web application. The Angular framework provides a dynamic and responsive front end, while Spring Boot serves as the backend, handling business logic and ensuring secure communication. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is employed to store and manage data efficiently.

## Key Features:

- **Angular Frontend:** A modern and interactive user interface built using Angular for a seamless user experience.

- **Spring Boot Backend:** A powerful backend developed with Spring Boot, providing RESTful APIs and managing business logic.

- **MongoDB Database:** Utilizes MongoDB as the database, offering flexibility and scalability for storing and retrieving data.

- **Secure Communication:** Implements secure communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:** The combination of Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB allows for scalability to accommodate growing data and user demands.

Feel free to contribute to this versatile project and explore the synergy of these technologies. Get started by cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and launching the application.
